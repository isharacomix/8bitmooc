Basic Architecture:


blog.8bitmooc.org               Tumblr
     8bitmooc.org/              Home page (index.html template rendered as view)
     8bitmooc.org/~username     Profile page with achievements, badges, and stuff
     8bitmooc.org/book/         The "textbook pages" (wiki pages saved in the
                                "textbook" app's content folder).
     8bitmooc.org/lesson/W-S    Lesson is a "tutorial style" textbook page
                                rendered next to the chat stream for World-Stage
     8bitmooc.org/challenge/W-S The exercise associated with the lesson.
     8bitmooc.org/playground    An assembler and stuff to play with

The textbook pages are not saved in a model, but are instead resources saved in
the textbook app as flatfiles. The lessons, however, are models that link to
textbook pages. This means that the lessons actually duplicate pages that are
in the "wiki". This allows people to read ahead if they like without having to
do the challenges.

Not all lessons need challenges and vice-versa. If one doesn't exist, it tries
to redirect you to the other.
