The course is divided into:

    Worlds  (Modules)
    Stages  (Lessons+Challenges)

As you complete stages, new stages are unlocked. Worlds are unclocked when
achievements (such as winning boss stages) are obtained. Stages are laid out
with graph-theory prereqs, which follows my original cartographer approach but
on a much smaller scale.

Each world covers a major topic of the course, while the stages allow for
branching, exploration, and even deeper learning (you can foray into smaller
nooks and crannies to get extra practice on concepts).


        WORLD 1-1               Normally, you can see all of the stages,
                                except for those with hidden requirements.
            o-----o----o        This encourages you to explore. In most cases,
            |     |             you can follow different routes to reach a boss,
            o     o    ?        and find "bonus solutions" (kind of like the
            |__ __|             warp zones) to short-circuit your way to the
              [ ]               boss levels.
              BOSS

Completing the entire course nets you a Mozilla Open Badge, and I'm still
deciding if I should just tack on "new worlds" to this game (it'd be fun to
totally go to another machine and play on the Atari II), or if I should make
a new website for that one. No telling at this point. If the "world" system
is able to gate out the content, then we can keep piling more stuff on. :)
