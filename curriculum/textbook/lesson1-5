= Lesson 1-5: Help, I need somebody!
Programming can be hard. Hopefully the first two assignments you attempted
weren't too difficult. As we start exploring more of the system, you may find
yourself getting stuck. Or you may be such a pro that you don't need anyone's
help - in which case maybe you can give your fellow learners a hand!

This short lesson will introduce you to the //SOS// feature of #8bitmooc.

== Did you see it?
On programming assignments, next to the assemble and download buttons is a
button labeled 'SOS'. When you click on this button, you will have the
opportunity to ask a question to your peers and show them your code.

When you successfully send an SOS, any student who has completed the stage you
are on will see a symbol stating that 'Someone here needs some help!', and
they will have the opportunity to respond to SOS requests. In fact, you might
have even seen some of these when you completed them for the first time!

If you feel like you're confident that you can help a peer learn something,
especially somthing that gave you trouble yourself, try to answer their questions.
If you manage to help out a peer, you'll earn some points, and even if you
feel like the problem was too complicated for you, you will still earn one
point for taking the time to go and read it. If an SOS goes a long time without
being answered, eventually the instructor will take get to it.
