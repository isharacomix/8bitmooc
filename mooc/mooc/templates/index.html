            <h3>Why 8-bit?</h3>
            <p>Video games have become a ubiquitous part of our culture,
            but where did they start? Compared to today's games, 8-bit
            games from the NES, the Atari, and the Gameboy may seem
            terribly primitive. However, underneath the pixelated sprites
            and low-resolution sound effects, the devices themselves are
            very sophisticated, and the programming required to make
            the iconic games of the era fit in their limited resources
            was a kind of craftmanship that we don't see in today's games.</p>

            <h3>Is this a game dev class?</h3>
            <p>If you're trying to learn how to make games, this is
            probably not the class for you. We will be intentionally
            challenging ourselves by developing games using the same
            platform with the same limitations as NES game developers.</p>
            <p>Or, as we like to put it: <em>This course won't teach you how to
            make Mario - it will teach you how to make Mario the way the people
            who made Mario made Mario.</em></p>

            <h3>Who is this course for?</h3>
            <p>Anyone interested in the history of technology will
            find something they can enjoy in this course. If you
            don't know how to program, this course is a great
            introduction. If you do, this course strips away
            the abstractions of higher level programming languages
            and demonstrates how the hardware implements the programs
            you write.</p>
            <p>No prior programming knowledge is needed to participate in this
            course.</p>
