            <h3>Is this a game dev class?</h3>
            <p>If you're trying to learn how to make games, this is
            probably not the class for you. We will be intentionally
            challenging ourselves by developing games using the same
            platform with the same limitations as NES game developers.</p>
            <p>This course won't teach you how to make Mario. It will
            teach you how to make Mario the way the people who made Mario
            made Mario.</p>

            <h3>Who is this course for?</h3>
            <p>Anyone interested in the history of technology will
            find something they can enjoy in this course. If you
            don't know how to program, this course is a great
            introduction. If you do, this course strips away
            the abstractions of higher level programming languages
            and demonstrates how the hardware implements the programs
            you write.</p>
