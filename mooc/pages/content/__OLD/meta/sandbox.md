Playground
==========
The playground is an environment where you can create NES programs from scratch.
Just write your code in the text box and assemble the code. It can take a bit
of effort to write a game from scratch, since the NES requires a good bit of
code to get something on the screen, so feel free to look under the *recently
published* tag to see what games others have made so that you don't have to
start with a blank slate.


Publishing
----------
Once you've reached a point where you'd like to share the game with the world,
you can publish the game by clicking the *publish* button under the emulator.
This will make the game appear in the *recently published* list on the sandbox
page, as well as on your profile page. You can link to this published game and
share it even with people who don't have accounts on #8bitmooc, and you can
download the ROM image for the game to play it on other emulators such as on
smartphones.

If you'd like an additional challenge beyond what #8bitmooc has to offer, you
can enter game development competitions such as 
[One Game a Month](http://onegameamonth.com) and
[Ludum Dare](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo). We host the games for you, so you
can simply share the links created when you publish your games and anyone who
visits can play them and download them for themselves.
