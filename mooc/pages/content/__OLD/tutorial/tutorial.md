NES Tutorial
============
Welcome to the NES Tutorial! This series of ten lecture videos and readings
covers all of the basics needed to get through the beginning of this course.
Unlike other MOOCs, where lecture videos basically make up the entire course
from beginning to end, these tutorial videos are only the beginning of #8bitmooc.
They are here to help you get started - after that, the rest is up to you.
