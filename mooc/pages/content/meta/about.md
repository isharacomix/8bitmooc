Welcome to #8bitmooc!
=====================

The best way to think about #8bitmooc is as a "history course with programming."
If you want to learn how to make games, there are much better and easier tools
that will help you make advanced games such as [GameMaker](http://yoyogames.com)
and [Unity3D](http://unity3d.com). It is a bit more difficult to use the NES
to make sophisticated programs, but it has been done to great success with too
many complicated and successful games to name here. This gets us to the whole
point of #8bitmooc:

**The primary goal of the class is to get you to solve problems using the same
tools and processes as game developers from the 1980's.**

Our philosophy is that you can't appreciate why old NES games looked, sounded,
and played the way they did until you see for youself what it took to put these
kinds of games together. By developing for a third-generation platform, you are
exposed to the same limitations and making the same compromises that developers
in the 1980's had to face, which teaches you more than any textbook or video
you can watch or read.

To reach this goal, the class is taught in a number of ways, and you are free
to pick the approach that comes most naturally to you. The most straightforward
way to advance through the class is by completing automatically graded
programming challenges, where you will be given a mostly-complete game and
asked to add some missing functionality to it. Your submissions will be graded
not only on correctness, but also on efficiency! You will be given the
opportunity to compete with your classmates for the most efficient solutions to
the programming assignments, encouraging you to learn new tricks and try things
out as you learn the ins-and-outs of the platform.

However, simply following instructions is no substitute for exploring the
possibilities on your own by making your own game. #8bitmooc gives you a
[workbench](http://learn.8bitmooc.org/project/) that you can use to develop and
[publish](http://learn.8bitmooc.org/arcade/) your own games for the world to
play. In addition to making games and sharing them with your #8bitmooc classmates,
you are also encouraged to develop games for so-called "game jams" such as
[Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com) and [One Game a Month](http://onegameamonth.com)
in order to share your work with the public.

Yet another way to learn is to critically discuss the NES with your classmates in
the forums. If you have experience programming, write about how different NES
programming is for you. If you're interested in music, share your thoughts about
NES chiptunes. Or discuss how long and complicated stories could be in order
to fit on an NES cartridge. Anything is fair game, and as you get farther in
the class, you'll earn access to new forums to discuss the content with your
peers.

We hope you'll find the course challenging and engaging, and can't wait to see
what you create while you're here. :)
