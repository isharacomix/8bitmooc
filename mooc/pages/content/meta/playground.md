Making your own games with the Playground
=========================================
Some of us don't do well when we are given requirements. Some of us prefer
open spaces that we can use as places to experiment and learn through trial
and error. In #8bitmooc, this space is called the **Playground**: an NES
emulator where you can write your own programs from scratch.

The Playground has no rules other than having to write code that compiles.
It can be challenging to learn in the playground, since the NES is a complicated
system that requires some time to boot up. However, we provide a [[warmup]]
program that takes care of most of this setup, leaving you with a template that
you can use to write your own programs. We also provide some sprite sheets that
you can use for graphics for your game.


Publishing
----------
When you get a game that you would like to share with the world, you can click
the "publish" button to make it available to everyone to play and learn from.
When you publish your game, it will appear in the sidebar on the right side of
the playground page as well as on your user profile page. If you share the link
of your recently published game, anyone else in the world can play it - even if
they aren't part of #8bitmooc - and the source code is also shared so that other
students can learn from your techniques.

You can also download the ROM and share it on message boards or your own website
so that it can be played in emulators on computers and even mobile devices! We
encourage you to join a game development competition like
[Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com) and try making a game on #8bitmooc and
submitting it as a competition entry.
