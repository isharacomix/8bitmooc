Levelling Up
============
In #8bitmooc, instead of grades, your progress is measured by an experience
point system. Every student begins the course at Level 1, and is considered
a graduate at Level 8. There are no deadlines, so you can proceed through the
course and earn experience points at your own pace, as quickly or slowly as
you like.

There are many ways to earn experience points in #8bitmooc. Automatically
graded programming challenges, game development competitions, and discussions on
the forums are some of the many ways to complete this course, and you're free
to choose your own path to completing the course. As you reach higher levels,
you'll unlock new challenges to test your knowledge and new forums to discuss
the course content at a deeper level.
