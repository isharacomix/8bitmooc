Internet Relay Chat
===================
[IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC) is an online chat protocol that's been
around since 1988. #8bitmooc has a channel on the popular Freenode server.
The downside is that your account isn't tied to the chat room. On the other
hand, if the #8bitmooc server is down, you can come to the channel to talk while
we work to bring it back up to speed!

If you aren't running an IRC client, you can reach the channel [here](/chat/).
