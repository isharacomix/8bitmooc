The Help Pages
==============
Welcome to the Help Pages for #8bitmooc! Put together, these pages make up what
can be considered the textbook for this course, and contains everything you need
to know in order to make games for the NES and to succeed in this class. Unlike
other courses, #8bitmooc doesn't just give you lecture videos and then ask you
to act out what you're told. Instead, you're given challenges that you have to
solve, and then it's up to you to read through the help pages to figure out
what you need to be able to do in order to complete them.

If you haven't read [[about the MOOC|about]] yet, now might be a good time
to do it.
