Forums
======
The forums are an open-ended arena for you to talk with your classmates about
NES programming. There are a number of forums where you can get and share
information. The forums are tiered by experience level, so as you complete
challenges you will unlock new forums. The idea behind this approach is that
by staggering access to forums, people are able to interact with people of their
experience level - advanced users won't have to see the same beginner questions
over and over again, and beginners won't be exposed to advanced material
before they are ready for it.


News and Announcments
---------------------
This forum is locked to site administrators to post news about the course.
Information about course changes, new additions, and other relevant material
will be shared here. Posts in this forum appear on the left side of the user
dashboard to make sure that you actually read them!


Newbie Central
--------------
This is the first forum that everyone has access to. There are no stupid
questions, so if you're having trouble figuring out how to make a program work,
this is a great place to ask.


Coder's Club
------------
This forum is for students who have successfully completed three programming
challenges. Free from the influence of newbies, this forum contains users who
have managed to grasp the basics of programming which should lead to less noisy
conversations than would be held in the newbie forum.


Advanced Programming
--------------------
Once you've completed six challenges, you've proven that you understand assembly,
and might even be ready to try your hand at making a game. If you want a serious
conversation about design decisions and optimization tricks, this is where you
might want to start those conversations, since these are the folks who have
managed to get past the halfway mark and are likely serious about finishing the
course as well.


Winner's Circle
---------------
This forum can only be read and written to by users who have completed all of
the course challenges as a prize for completing the course. The hope is that
conversations in this forum will be held by users who have learned most of the
technical material of the course, meaning that the conversations in this forum
will usually be of a more rigorous caliber.
