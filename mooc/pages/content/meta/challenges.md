Challenge-based learning
========================
On the right side of your [dashboard](/) is a list of ten programming challenges
designed to test your ability to use the features of the NES to solve problems.
The help center has a number of tutorials, but these tutorials will not teach
you how to solve the challenges. Instead, the tutorials will teach you how to
use the NES documentation in order to find these solutions for yourself.

We believe that the most important skill that #8bitmooc teaches you is
**how to read a spec sheet**. A spec sheet provides the interface for a machine -
all of the actions that you can take, and how those actions affect the machine.
Solving a programming problem is simply a matter of taking the right actions in
the right order. The only way to learn how to program is to go through the
problem-solving process yourself.

The final challenge requires you to make a video game yourself, from scratch.
This is, in fact, simply a way to encourage you to set a task to complete, and
by setting that task, you will create your own problems and solutions. The
other challenges, ordered from least difficult to most difficult, are simply
scaffolding to help you program in a controlled environment before taking on
the NES by yourself.


Records
-------
It's not enough just to solve a problem. The NES is a very limited device. If
your code takes too long, your framerate could slow down and lag the game. If
your code takes up too much space, you won't be able to fit as many features in
your project. Each time you complete a challenge, we calculate the size of your
program and the number of instructions it takes to complete the task. This means
that even when you complete the challenge, a new one opens up - the challenge
of simply *doing better*. Your fastest and smallest program will be displayed for
your reference, along with the best records in the entire class.

If someone manages to surpass your record, don't feel bad! It gives you an
opportunity to rethink your solution and think about where you could do things
differently, since that proves that there's a better way to write it.


SOS
---
We all need help from time to time. If you ever find yourself completely stuck
on a challenge either on your first run through, or while trying to optimize
it, click on the SOS button. This will allow you to share your code and ask a
question to your peers that they can then answer and try to help you. Once you
complete an exercise, you can be a part of this process by clicking the red button
that appears next to your completed challenges - if a student has requested help,
you'll be able to share your expertise with them.

When asking questions, try to make your questions as specific as possible.
Not only will it help your classmates answer your questions more effectively,
it will also save you from having to send multiple requests out. If you want
to help make this class amazing, we encourage you to take part in the SOS system,
since you might learn something seeing another student's approach.
