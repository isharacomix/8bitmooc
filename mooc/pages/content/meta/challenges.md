Challenges
==========
The most straightforward way to test your programming skills in #8bitmooc is
by attempting assembly challenges.

In most cases, a challenge is an incomplete NES game that is missing some
vital functionality. Your challenge is to read the description of what needs
to be done and implement it. Every time you compile your code, it will test it
against its acceptance tests. Once it passes, the challenge will be marked
*complete*, and you'll be awarded some number of experience points.

Note that the challenge description only tells you *what* you need to do...
not *how* to do it. It's up to you to determine what you need to teach yourself
in order to successfully complete the challenge.


Size and Speed Records
----------------------
After completing a challenge, you aren't done yet! The NES is a very limited
platform, so it isn't enough to just make your code work - your code has to
be efficient!

Every time you clear a challenge, your code is evaluataed on two metrics:
*size* (the number of bytes of compiled code your program takes) and *speed*
(the number of instructions read until the subroutine returns). Normally, there
is a tradeoff between size and speed, so normally to make your program faster,
you have to make it bigger and vice-versa. Pick a target and use every trick
at your disposal in order to make your solution the most efficient in the
entire course.


SOS
---
If you're having trouble with a challenge, you can send an SOS to classmates
who have already completed it in order to get some personalized help. By
clicking the SOS button (next to the "run" and "download" buttons), you are
given the opportunity to ask a single question which your peers will then
attempt to answer for you. Your classmates will not give you the answer, but
if there is something about either the requirements or the programming language
that you are having trouble with, this is a great place to express that.

If you've already completed the challenge, you'll see an SOS button on the
challenge selection page that shows the number of classmates who are currently
seeking help for the exercise. By clicking this button, you will be shown their
question and given an opportunity to help them out, earning a few XP in the
process for your trouble. After providing your feedback, they will then have
a chance to say whether your response was helpful or not helpful, and if it
turns out it was, you will receive more.

You can submit an SOS any time during a challenge - even if you've already
completed it, and are looking for help to beat the record.
