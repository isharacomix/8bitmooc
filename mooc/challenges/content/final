Are you ready for this? Everything that you've done in #8bitmooc has been
scaffolding to help you learn how the NES functions, and now it's time to
get past the exercises and do some real work - it's time to make a game for
the NES.

All of the challenges up until now have taught you various parts of the NES,
from its programming language to its hardware. Putting it all together is a
challenge in and of itself, and not to be taken lightly. Come up with an idea
of what you want to make, plan out how you will use your 2 KB of memory, and
then try to make it work. If it doesn't work out the first few times, feel
free to scrap it and start over. Use the [[warmup]] code as a starting point.

If you need any help at all with this project, please interact with your
classmates on the forums. If you've managed to complete other challenges
prior to this one, you will have access to forums that are locked to
advanced students, giving you an audience who is likely as serious about
completing this course as you are. You are more than welcome to use the
playground to publish demos of your game before it's ready to go.

When you're ready to submit your project for grading, click on the "Done"
button. One of the instructors will take a look at it and provide feedback
on your project.
