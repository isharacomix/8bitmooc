In the true open source spirit, this project is only possible thanks to the
projects I borrowed from to make it work.


    NCSULUG Website
        Served as the template from which I gave birth to this project. I stole
        the wikicreole markup that I use extensively in this project from them.

    JSNES
        A JavaScript NES Emulator that serves as the easy-to-use way for
        students to explore their code in realtime.

    Bootstrap
        If it wasn't for Bootstrap, the MOOC wouldn't look nearly as good as it
        does. Thanks, Twitter!

        The ultimate guide to the NES, 6502, and where I learned everything I
        know about the platform.
